<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.sentinel_1.water</em> detects water areas in Sentinel-1 GRD scenes using automatic
or manual thresholding and region growing. Water areas are corrected using a
Height-Above-Nearest-Drainage (HAND) raster.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>i.sentinel_1.water</em> allows for automatic or manual thresholding of calibrated
Sentinel-1 GRD data in log_dB format. If automatic thresholding is applied,
the image is tiles into a regular grid of 500x500 Pixels and the histogram is
calculated for each tile. The histogram is smoothed and checked for bimodality
by counting the relative maxima. If the histogram is bimodal, the dB-value of
the first peak as well as the valley between the peaks (identified using the
minimum filter from python's skimage package) are saved. If no bimodal tiles are
identified, the process is repeated on tiles of size 400x400 pixels, and then
300x300 Pixels.
Global thresholds are then identified by averaging the db-values of first peaks
and histogram valleys from all tiles. The average of the first peaks is used as
threshold to identify core water areas. The average of the h√≠stogram valleys is
used as threshold to identify the maximum possible water extent. Alternatively,
both thresholds can be passed by the <b>water_core_thresh</b> and
<b>water_boundary_thresh</b> parameters when the <b>-m</b> flag is activated.
The core water areas are used as seeds for the region growing algorithm of
<a href="i.segment.html">r.s1.grd</a>, where the Sentinel-1 scene is used as
input. The maximum possible water extent is included as boundary map in the
region growing process. Only those regions that originate from the seeds are
saved from the region growing process and classified as water areas. Finally,
the water areas are corrected using a threshold for the provided Height-Above-
Nearest-Drainage (HAND) raster.
